In many automata, there are multiple possible transitions out of a state.  In 
this case, you have a choice as to which transition to run. 

Whenever a transition has `ε` as its label, it does not read anything from 
input.

Sometimes, you make a mistake and get stuck. In that case, press the *Reset* 
button to restart the level.
