From now, the levels will be what is called **Priority Queue Automata** (or 
**PQAs** for short). These are like NFAs but also have a **priority queue** 
which it can insert or remove elements from. 

For this level, there is only a single possible **priority** (`1`) and a 
single possible **queue symbol** (`x`) so you do not have to worry about 
exactly how the queue works just yet other than that it can contain "duplicates". 

Each transition of a PQA can insert or remove a symbol from the queue at a 
given priority. For example, the left transition, `ε : ∅ ↦ (x, 1)`, is read 
as "The PQA reads no input, removes nothing from the queue then inserts `x` 
at priority `1`." Similarly, the right transition `ε : (x, 1) ↦ ∅` should be 
read as "The PQA reads no input, removes some `x` at priority `1` from the 
queue and inserts nothing".

As the languages generated by PQAs cannot be represented by a regular 
expression, these levels will not include a description of the language of 
the automata.
