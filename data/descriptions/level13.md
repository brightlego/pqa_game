What makes a priority queue different from other datastructures is that if 
you have an element of high priority, it must be removed before any elements 
of lower priority. However, you can still insert elements of low priority 
into the queue.

Additionally, unlike the input word, the queue does **not** have to be empty 
for the automaton to accept.
